# WGU Python Mini Projects

This repo contains small Python programs I wrote to practice:
- Reading problem descriptions
- Turning them into flowcharts
- Converting flowcharts into `if/elif/else` logic in Python

## Projects

1. **Graduation Checker**
   – Asks for completed credits, required credits, GPA, and capstone status.
   – Tells you if you're eligible to graduate or what you're missing.

2. **Study Time Planner**
   – Asks how many courses you're taking and hours you can study per week.
   – Tells you if you're on track or might fall behind.

3. **Financial Aid Recommender**
   – Uses GPA, income, credits, and first-gen status.
   – Suggests what type of aid tier you might qualify for.

4. **WGU Term Load Advisor**
   – Calculates recommended course load based on work status.
   – Helps determine if your classes are balanced, heavy, or light for the term.

5. **Secret Word Guess**
   – The computer selects a random secret word, and the user must guess what it is.
   – Still implemented **without loops**, using nested `if / elif / else`.

6. **Menu Ordering System (+ Total Cost)**
  
   – A console-based menu program where the user selects an item by entering a number (1–3).
   – The program then displays the item ordered and calculates total cost.
   – An optional drink can be added before the final bill is displayed.
   
7. **High–Low Number Guessing Game**

   – The computer selects a random number between 1 and 10.  
   – The user has **three attempts** to guess the number correctly.
