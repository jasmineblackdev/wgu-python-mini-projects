# WGU Python Mini Projects

A collection of beginner-friendly Python exercises created to strengthen problem-solving skills and code logic.  
Each project starts with reading a challenge, breaking it into a flowchart, then converting that logic into `if / elif / else` statements.

No loops were used in early versions on purpose — to build strong logical thinking first.

## 📂 Project List

### 1. 🎓 Graduation Checker  
Asks for required credits, completed credits, GPA, and capstone status.  
Outputs whether the student is eligible to graduate or what requirements are still missing.

### 2. 🕒 Study Time Planner  
Takes number of courses + available weekly study hours.  
Estimates whether the student is on pace or may fall behind.

### 3. 💰 Financial Aid Recommender  
Uses inputs such as GPA, income, credit load, and first-generation status.  
Suggests possible tiers of aid or scholarships a student may qualify for.

### 4. 📘 WGU Term Load Advisor  
Recommends course load based on work hours and study availability.  
Helps determine whether a term plan is *balanced*, *heavy*, or *light*.

### 5. 🔐 Secret Word Guess  
- Random secret word from a list  
- User guesses one word at a time  
- Built without loops using nested conditionals  
- Expanded version allows multiple guess attempts  

**Skills:** lists, string logic, `random.choice()`, `.lower()` input handling

---

### 6. 🍔 Menu Ordering System (+ Total Cost)  
- User selects menu item by number (1–3)  
- Price is added to a running total  
- Program asks if they want to add a drink  
- Outputs final total at the end  

**Skills:** parallel lists, user input, arithmetic, conditional flow

---

### 7. 🔢 High–Low Number Guessing Game  
- Computer picks a number between **1–10**  
- User gets three attempts to guess it  
- Program returns **Higher / Lower / You Win**  

**Skills:** comparison operators, nested conditionals, program branching

---

### 8. 🔐 PyPassword Generator  
Interactive password generator that builds a randomized password based on user preferences.

- User chooses how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** to include  
- Characters are selected from predefined lists  
- The final password list is shuffled, then joined into a single string  

**Skills:** lists, `for` loops, `random.choice()`, `random.shuffle()`, string joining (`"".join()`), user input

---

### 9. 🧾 2K Name Generator  
Generates random full names by combining first and last names.

- User chooses how many names to generate  
- Program randomly selects a first name and last name for each result  
- Useful for testing, placeholder data, or character ideas  

**Skills:** lists, `for` loops, `random.choice()`, f-strings, user input, basic program structure

## 🚀 Next Steps in Progress

- Rewriting select programs using **loops** (`while`, `for`)  
- Adding replay options + multiple rounds  
- Introducing functions to reduce repeated code  

These projects mark the foundation of my Python development journey — step by step, leveling up.through logic, structure, and design.
